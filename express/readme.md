expressworks
======================================

This is definitely so far the most buggy workshop in nodeschool in my 
opinion!

Anyway, learning express and building a well-structured website is not
that easy--and not that hard either. So if you want to try express, read
the requirement here and get the idea the things that you may need if you
start express, then go ahead and node it without doing this tutorial!
